# SudokuHelp
Excel workbook to help a person solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle by tracking possible numbers left for each cell.
This spreadsheet does not use VBA macros as it is an attempt to do the necessary logic with just formulae.
It was prompted by the paper and pencil method used by my partner to solve sudoku puzzles.
